# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Features
- **Multi-class Classification**: Classifies tweets into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Allows users to input tweets and get real-time sentiment predictions.

## Sample Tweets
